# Poverty and FDI

## milestones
1. presentation
2. paper
3. incorporate conference comments
4. publish
5. expand


big picture for the presentation we are neutral on the outcome

inclusive growth

trade increases output but also increases inequality
trade doesn't decrease poverty?

rural-urban divide

e.g. Del Monte in Kenya

from the presentation we are hoping to receive some local insights

CFTA

get more slides
straighten out how we name things
diadic relationship between the US and sub-Saharan Africa

make trend graphs:
- inbound, outbound
- trade, FDI

## measures of poverty
- poverty headcount ratio: breadth of poverty
- poverty gap -- mean gap relative to cutoff: depth

## tasks
- [ ] read about fixed effects, clustering coefficients
- [ ] lit review
- [ ] create trend graphs
- [x] why there are 2 F-tests
- [ ] formatting regression results
- [ ] replicate the four models******
- [ ] stylized examples
- [ ] read that Addis article******
- [ ] what other variables should we include

## Questions
- should we consider a 2-stage regression with FDI
- shoudl we get the ICRG that LeGoff/Singh and Asiedu use rather than the WB effectiveness measure that produces negative results
- should we replace FDI with FDI/GDP


## Other things to do
1. look at how FDI, GDP, poverty have trended in SSA since 2000
2. look at how poverty gap, poverty headcount ratio has trended: poverty was supposed to decline by half from 2000-2015 according to MDGs
3.
