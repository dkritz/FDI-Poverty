trade_free,"Index of Economic Freedom: Trade Freedom component (0-100, least to greatest freedom)","Heritage Foundation, Index of Economic Freedom",http://www.heritage.org/index/,"Trade freedom is a composite measure of the extent of tariff and nontariff barriers that affect imports and exports of goods and services. The component, one of three under the open markets category, is graded using a scale from 0 to 100, where 100 represents the maximum freedom. The trade freedom score is based on two inputs: The trade-weighted average tariff rate and non-tariff barriers (NTBs). Different imports entering a country can (and often do) face different tariffs. The weighted average tariff uses weights for each tariff based on the share of imports for each good. The index determines the extent of NTBs in a country's trade policy regime using both qualitative and quantitative information. There are four types of NTBs considered in the scoring: Quantity restrictions, regulatory restrictions, customs restrictions, and direct government intervention. In addition, where possible, the index considers and reports the number of nontariff measures in force as calculated by the World Trade Organization. To preserve consistency in grading the trade freedom component, the Index uses the most recently reported weighted average tariff rate for a country from out primary source. If another reliable source reports more updated information on the country's tariff rate, this fact is noted, and the grading of this component may be reviewed if there is strong enough evidence that the most recently reported weighted average tariff rate is outdated. The most comprehensive and consistent information on weighted average applied tariff rates is published by the World Bank. When the weighted average tariff rate is not available, the Index uses the country's average applied tariff rate; when the country's average applied tariff rate is not available, the weighted average or the simple average of most favored nation (MFN) tariff rates is used. In the very few cases where data on duties and customs revenues are not available, data on international trade taxes or an estimated effective tariff rate are used instead. The Index relies on the following sources to determine scores for trade policy, in order of priority: World Bank, World Development Indicators; World Trade Organization, Trade Policy Review; Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers; World Bank, Doing Business; U.S. Department of Commerce, Country Commercial Guide; Economist Intelligence Unit, Country Commerce; World Economic Forum, The Global Enabling Trade Report; and official government publications of each country. For more information on the equation used to calculate the base trade freedom score see https://www.heritage.org/index/pdf/2020/book/methodology.pdf."

fdi,Foreign direct investment (FDI)  inflows ($US millions),"UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), UNCTADstat",http://unctadstat.unctad.org/EN/,"Foreign direct investment (FDI) is an investment made by a resident enterprise in one economy (direct investor or parent enterprise) with the objective of establishing a lasting interest in an enterprise that is resident in another economy (direct investment enterprise or foreign affiliate). The lasting interest implies the existence of a long-term relationship between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. The ownership of 10% or more of the voting power of a direct investment enterprise by a direct investor is evidence of such a relationship. FDI flows are transactions recorded during the reference period (typically year or quarter). FDI flows include the three following components: equity capital, reinvested earnings, and intra-company debt. Net decreases in assets or net increases in liabilities are recorded as credits, while net increases in assets or net decreases in liabilities are recorded as debits. Hence, FDI flows with a negative sign indicate that at least one of the three components of FDI is negative and not offset by positive amounts of the remaining components. These are called reverse investment or disinvestment."
