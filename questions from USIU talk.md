# USIU Notes Jan 23, 2020

- [ ]	How is our approach different from Bono, or Jefferey Sachs?
- [ ]	The type of FDI matters
- [ ]	SSA MNEs have a bigger impact on poverty and employment
- [ ]	Resource- vs market-seeking investment
- [ ]	Income distribution matters
- [ ]	Rural/urban divide matters
- [ ]	Who is hit the hardest? Women and youth
- [ ]	Perhaps try multidimensional poverty indices
- [ ]	AGOA’s influence on FDI
- [ ]	Capital flight
- [ ]	Education, Population, the truth dilate, the animal we ate
- [ ]	Role of portfolio investment—is it targeted by sector?


## Dave's initial response to the USIU questions
- Let's add outward-bound FDI to our model
- WWJSS? What Would Jeffrey Sachs Say?
- re: "Resouce- vs. market-seeking investment": The Appiah? paper that we read right before the presentation classified each SSA country into one of four types. I wonder if we can also classify FDI into types. Was that the data that the guy you talked to was talking about? He was building that data? 
- incorporate more measures of poverty, or actually build a model with multiple dependent variables? Right now we have two separate models for two distinct measures of poverty
- adding more things on the righthand side could be INXS of our mandate
- we talked about the rural-urban divide, but didn't incorporate it into the model.... but are we fine with not caring where the new jobs come from? China model
