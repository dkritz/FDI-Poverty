# FDI-Poverty

Originally I just wanted to share the IPythonNB over the web without Michael needing to set it up, since he's using Stata. 

But then I had a local directory on my laptop with local data etc and decided it would be a good idea to consolidate files.

However the paper drafts, original data downloads, and literature in PDF and DOC format will stay in Google Drive.
